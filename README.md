# sample-code

This repository contains sample code making use of Passfolio's open source projects.

These include examples for at least [react-bindings](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bindings) and [react-waitables](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-waitables), but for a complete listing of our open source projects, see [Open Source @ Passfolio](https://github.com/Passfolio).

Each sub-folder of the "samples" folder includes a project that can be installed and run independently.

The general pattern for use of a sample project is:

- `cd samples/<project>`
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`
